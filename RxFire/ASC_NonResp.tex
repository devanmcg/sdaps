\begin{itemize}
     \item For this survey, \textbf{prescribed fire} and \textbf{burning} refer to \emph{the intentional application of fire to an area of land for management purposes}.
      \item Most questions will ask if you agree or disagree with one or more statements. 
	     Some questions will simply ask you to respond Yes or No. 
	    For all questions, fill in the box or circle to select. 
      \item If you do not know the answer to a question, select {\framebox{DK}} for ``Don't Know"
      \item If you feel a question does not apply to you enough to provide an answer, select \framebox{NA} for ``Not Applicable''
      \item When you are finished, please place the survey in the prepaid return envelope and mail it to the researchers at your earliest convenience.
\end{itemize}
